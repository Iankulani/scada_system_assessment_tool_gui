SCADA System Assessment Tool GUI is a user-friendly graphical interface designed to assess the security posture and operational integrity of SCADA (Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition) systems.


Tailored for utility companies, industrial plants, and government infrastructure, this tool provides comprehensive visibility into the health and security of critical control environments.

The interface allows engineers, analysts, and cybersecurity professionals to easily navigate and interact with system components. 
Through real-time monitoring dashboards, the GUI displays key performance indicators, system architecture maps, communication protocols, and event logs. 
It highlights vulnerabilities in network segments, unauthorized access attempts, outdated firmware, misconfigurations, and possible threats such as malware, trojans, and zero-day exploits.

One of its powerful features is the automated vulnerability scanning module, which identifies weak points in connected Programmable Logic Controllers (PLCs), Remote Terminal Units (RTUs), 
and Human-Machine Interfaces (HMIs). The GUI includes visual alerts, risk scoring, and detailed logs for incident tracking and mitigation planning.

Additionally, the tool supports simulation-based cyber drill scenarios, allowing organizations to test their response readiness in a controlled environment. 
The GUI makes it easy to schedule, execute, and review cyber drills focused on ransomware, insider threats, and nation-state attacks that target SCADA infrastructure.

With built-in reporting features, users can generate PDF or Excel-based assessment reports detailing system risks, recommendations, and compliance levels aligned with NIST, ISA/IEC 62443, and ISO 27001 standards. 
The interface supports multi-user access, role-based controls, and integrates with SIEM and threat intelligence platforms.

In essence, the SCADA System Assessment Tool GUI empowers organizations to proactively manage cyber risk, ensure uptime of critical infrastructure, 
and achieve regulatory complianceâ€”all within an intuitive and visually engaging interface.
